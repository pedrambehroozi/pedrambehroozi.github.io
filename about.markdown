My name is Pedram. I am a Software Engineer. I have been a SE since 2011. But my knowledge of developing
software is not great, it has a reason. I hate it! Mostly because every software nowadays have become a tool
for collecting visitor's data, sell their information in the name of delivering "Personalized experience", and 
manipulating them to "buy" stuff, whether it is a service, a real object, or just visits and likes.
I **hate** this approach. I think it is hurting people, bad for the environment, and by simplifying the world,
enables the governments and their business partners to supress people.

I think we have a great power over everything. We need to be more ethical, more
political, we all must be activists, and we must act. **Now**!
