title: How I'm Degoogling My Life [WIP]
---

1. [**DuckDuckGo**](https://duckduckgo.com): instead of [google.com](https://google.com)

  One of the worst thing about Google is the [filter bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble) it creates.

  Search for ["Why the earth is flat?"](https://www.google.com/search?q=why+earth+is+flat&source=hp&ei=nv3JYsaRJon-kwWhor7gDg&iflsig=AJiK0e8AAAAAYsoLrlXXdo9oKks-NSwh3oprydGTRoRg&ved=0ahUKEwjG2LaR6uz4AhUJ_6QKHSGRD-wQ4dUDCAg&uact=5&oq=why+earth+is+flat&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQgAEIAEMggIABCABBDHAzILCAAQHhDHAxAWEAo6BQguEIAEOgsILhCABBDHARDRAzoGCAAQHhAWOggIABAeEA8QFlAAWJYbYKYcaABwAHgAgAHzAYgBgwySAQYxNS4xLjGYAQCgAQE&sclient=gws-wiz) on Google. I can't find one single link in which I can read the flat-earthians argument. Instead Google gives me "useful" links, in which [people are argueing that why the idea is so stupid](https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2016/jan/26/earth-totally-flat-conspiracy-bob). This is true though. The idea is stupid. But why? What is the argument of the stupid people who belive in it? You can'f figure this out using Google. It gives you what you want to read.

  But [search the same phrase](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=why+earth+is+flat&t=newext&ia=web) on DDG. The second link would be of one of "those people", who actually believes the earth is flat, and you can read their argument. Ain't it nice?

  The filter bubble can have much worst affects on your opinions about the world. Say, you believe your religion, a certain political party, the thing your grandma said to you thirty years ago is right. Google is trained to tell you you're right, and there's no chance for you to read other's opinions, arguments, and discourse. The reason imo: [To make you predictable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNormalisation).

2. [**Firefox**](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?redirect_source=firefox-com): instead of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

  *tbd*

3. [**/e/**](https://e.foundation): insteead of [Android](https://www.android.com/)

  *tbd*

4. [**email**] instead of [Gmail](https://gmail.com):

  I haven't find a good replacement yet, and I've been using Gmail for the past 15 years or so. Finding a substitute is difficult, but I'm looking.

  This much I remember: We loved Gmail when we all had [Yahoo! email addresses](https://mail.yahoo.com)!
