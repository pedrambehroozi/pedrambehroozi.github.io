1. **Visions of Gerard** *by Jack Kerouac*

I love Kerouac's writing style. I have read *On the Road* which I absolutely adore, and *Big Sur* which I have
finished recently. On the first page of this book there is a handwriting that says:

> Dr. Christian,
>
>           This is a present
>
> of mine so that you may share
>
> some of the literature that
>
> I love in the same fashion
>
> that you presented Blake.
>
> Taking this class has
>
> altered so much in my
>
> traditional approach to
>
> literature, and for this
>
> I am eternally grateful.
>
> Whatever may have evolved
>
> in the classroom will never
>
> be representative of the
>
> amount I learned. Again
>
> Thank You.
>
>           love
>
>           Alen S. Lova (?)

There's no date on the note, and I'm not sure if I have spelled the name correctly.
Nonetheless I love reading these notes on the used books.

2. **Fiesta: The Sun Also Rises** *by Ernest Hemingway*

The title, at the first glance, is giving hope, right? The sun brings the day and the day
and the light are always carry hope. But the title comes from Ecclesiastes, and when you read the passage
you understand, more or less, that what Hemingway talked about in the book:

> The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
>
> Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all *is* vanity.
>
> What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?
>
> *One* generation passeth away, and *another* generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.
>
> The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.

3. **The Alexandria Quartet** *by Lawrence Durrell*

This quartet consists of: **Justine**, **Balthazar**, **Mountolive**, and **Clea**.
I have no idea what the books are, nor I have read any work by Durrell. This one
is a recommendation from [Sahel](https://www.instagram.com/sahelsworld/).

**Justine**, **Balthazar**, and **Clea** are published by Pocket Books in the 60s, where the covers were
hand-drawn, sometimes cheesy paintings of the characters, and the places in the books. A warning is printed
in the first page: 

> Not for sale in the British Empire market

Which is quite funny.
