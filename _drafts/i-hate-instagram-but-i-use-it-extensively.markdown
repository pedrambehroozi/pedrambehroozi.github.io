title: I hate Instagram, but I use it extensively
---

I hate [Instagram](https://instagram.com). I think it sells our information like grocery stores sell carrots.
The sad thing is I use it extensively, because this is ([almost](https://telegram.org)) the only source I have to
receive news from Iran, my *beloved* motherland. The reason is this is the only social media that is not filtered
in Iran yet. I'm following some news channels, and also my family and my friends are there.
